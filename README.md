utf8info
========

**utf8info** is a small utility that reads UTF-8 on stdin and prints out the raw codepoint information. It's useful for seeing exactly what a string contains, and for catching things like U+202E "RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE" and all of the different types of space (because there are [more than you might assume](https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/chars/spaces.html)).
